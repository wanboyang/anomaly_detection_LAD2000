# Introduction
This repository is established for Anomaly detection in video sequences: A benchmark and computational model. In this repository, we provide a video anomaly detection database named LAD2000, which contains 2000 videos and 13 anomaly categories. The original paper can be found [here]().

## Requirements
* Python 3
* CUDA
* numpy
* tqdm
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) (1.2)
* [torchvision](http://pytorch.org/)  
Recommend: the environment can be established by run

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```


## Data preparation


1.Download the original videos (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Mm8-k9zLOdM2Wm0PNygPlA password: rh4s) 

2.Extract i3d visual features for LAD2000, you can clone this project (link: https://github.com/wanboyang/anomly_feature.pytorch) and just set --dataset to LAD2000.

or you can directly use the i3d features of our LAD2000

1.Download the i3d features(https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Mm8-k9zLOdM2Wm0PNygPlA password: rh4s) and unpress the i3d.zip.

2.change the "dataset_path" to "you/path/i3d"



## Class_index
```
class_dict = {'Drop': 3, 'Loitering': 9, 'Crash': 0, 'Violence': 13, 'FallIntoWater': 4, 'Fire': 7, 'Fighting': 6, 'Crowd': 1, 'Destroy': 2, 'Falling': 5, 'Trampled': 12, 'Thiefing': 11, 'Panic': 10, 'Hurt': 8}

```

## Training

For LAD2000 database:

```
LAD2000T_i3d.sh
```

For ped2 database:

```
sh ped2_i3d.sh
```

For shanghaitech database:

```
sh ped2_i3d.sh
```

For Avenue database:

```
sh Avenue_i3d.sh
```

For UCF_Crime database:


```
sh UCF_i3d.sh
```

The models and testing results will be created on ./ckpt and ./results respectively
